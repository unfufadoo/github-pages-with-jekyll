I've been thinking alot lately about my future, and about women mostly. Both of these things apply to the future, but they don't both have equal value.

Women for example just get in the way from my experience, and more importantly make me feel like shit. What's the point of continuing to pursue that when it just leads to pain over and over ? 

Other more important things I'm into: 
  * Gaming on Destiny 2
  * Learning Sound Production
  * Amazon business to make some side folding money
  * Fixing up my house
  * Selling it and moving to Vienna for 2 years
    * OR Selling it and moving to Wales for 2 years
  * Getting a Psychology degree for myself, even if I don't ever use it.
