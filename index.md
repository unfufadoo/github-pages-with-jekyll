# Unfufadoo's site

This repository is simply for learning about GitHub and how to work with it. The reasoning being that once I get comfortable working with it, and I can then store my own code on here. I don't particularly care if someone steals my code at this point, since none of the code I've written is particularly advanced or intelligent. I'm just a beginner hobbling along trying to understand this crazy world we live in and make enough money for myself to not die a pauper or a leech. 

*I guess that's it; I'll be going now*
